### Level Up Your Skills: Mastering the Art of Learning

So, there's this cool concept called deliberate practice, brought to you by the brainiac Cal Newport. It's all about stepping out of your comfort zone to really nail down those skills. Here's how it plays out in the coding world:

- **Ditch the Boring Stuff**: Don't just keep building the same ol' apps. Focus on the tricky bits and break 'em down for some serious practice.
- **Challenge Accepted**: When's the last time you tackled a brain-busting coding problem? It's time to flex those mental muscles!
- **Craft Your Challenges**: Since you're your own boss here, set up challenges that hit the sweet spot:
  - _Just a Tad Tough_: Not a walk in the park, but doable.
  - _Repeat, Repeat, Repeat_: Keep at it until it's second nature.
  - _Feedback Loop_: Code either works or it doesn't—pretty straightforward.
  - _Brain Workout_: You should feel like you just ran a marathon, but for your brain.
  - _Learn Something New_: Each challenge should teach you something cool.
- **Chart Your Progress**: Keep tabs on how you're doing so you know where to focus.
- **Get Some Feedback**: Don't be shy—ask the pros for their thoughts on your work.
- **Learn from Mistakes**: When you mess up (it happens to the best of us), take a sec to figure out what went wrong. It's all about that growth mindset!

### Embracing the 'Power of Yet'

This speaker is all about the "power of yet" in schools, advocating for a mindset where failure is seen as an opportunity to grow. They emphasize the importance of praising effort over innate talent. The speaker provides examples of schools where adopting this mindset significantly improved students' academic performance. Ultimately, they argue for creating learning environments that foster growth and view failure as a necessary step towards success.

### Unlocking Success: The Power of Grit in Education

It's all about grit - that determination to stick with your goals. The speaker shifted from a tough job to teaching and found that grit is crucial for success. But teaching grit is still a puzzle. They talk about "growth mindset" but need more testing. Basically, they're saying grittier kids are essential for success.
