## Relational Databases:

- Organize data into tables (rows and columns).
- Tables have relationships with each other through keys.
- Primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.
- Foreign keys link rows between different tables.
- Support ACID properties for reliable transactions:
  - Atomicity: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
  - Consistency: Data is consistent before and after transactions.
  - Isolation: Transactions do not interfere with each other.
  - Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it remains so.

## SQL (Structured Query Language):

- The language used to interact with relational databases.
- Consists of commands to create, read, update, and delete data.
- Uses queries to retrieve and manipulate data across tables.
- Supports DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language).
