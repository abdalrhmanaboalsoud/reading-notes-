### Public Key Cryptography - Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

**Description:** This video explains the history and concept of public key cryptography and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Public key cryptography enables secure communication between parties without the need to share a secret key in advance.
- The Diffie-Hellman algorithm allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
- The video illustrates the security of the Diffie-Hellman method using examples like modular arithmetic and color mixing.

### Understanding Hashing in Cryptography

**Description:** This article explores hashing, a fundamental technique in cryptography.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Hash functions transform input data (plaintext) into a fixed-length output (hash value).
- Hashes are designed to be irreversible and produce unique outputs for each unique input.
- Common applications of hashing include password storage and data integrity verification.
